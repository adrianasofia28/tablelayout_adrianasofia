		<p style="text-align:justify;margin:1px;padding:15px;">Assalamualaikum and Hi. My Name is Siti Nur Adriana Sofia Binti Mohd Zahini. I am 21 years on September.I am from Kuala Lumpur and have a huge families.I have 8 siblings and I am no 6.Each of us have pur own behaviour that usually my mom will be screamed at us.But that was way back long ago it is we are old enough and my mom was tired to be screamed at us. </p>
	
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin:1px;padding:15px;">Fight between in my families its just normal to me.I know its kinda rough but bet with me sometimes its just better than be silent of each other.It is because,from the fight itself will make us more close.Time by time, everyone is mature enough to handle this kind of thing.Slowly each of will get their own family and raise it up.From that of memories, i will be missing them when they have their own family.</p>
